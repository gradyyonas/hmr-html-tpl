    <p>&ldquo;As a health ministry student, I know the importance of God&rsquo;s health message in reaching souls,&rdquo; says Lanardo Rolle, a recent volunteer at the AMEN free health clinic. &ldquo;Seeing the long line of people waiting to receive free medical treatment brought joy to my heart. By offering simple chair massages, I was rewarded with big smiles and not one person refused my offer of prayer. Barriers were broken down, people&rsquo;s hearts were opened for the gospel, and God was glorified.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>On September 18, 2016, twenty-five Hartland staff and students joined Adventist Medical Evangelism Network (AMEN) and other volunteers in holding a free health clinic at the General Conference Headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. About 700 patients came from the community to be treated. Volunteers served in stations such as Registration, Dental, Vision, Lifestyle Counseling, Hospitality, Massage Therapy, Chaplaincy, and more. The chaplains and massage therapists in particular were able to talk more personally with the patients.</p>
    <p>It was a life-changing experience for many. Stephen Rajan, a pastoral evangelism student, says, &ldquo;Being a chaplain, I had the privilege to minister to people&rsquo;s spiritual needs and give free copies of Steps to Christ, health books, and other literature to nearly 200 people.&rdquo; In one instance, Stephen was able to share with an atheist about God&rsquo;s existence. This man was open to the truth and took a few books to read.</p>

    <p>Our health outreach instructor, Ivonne Restrepo, volunteered in Hospitality and Translation. &ldquo;I met a couple from Medellin, Colombia, where I was born,&rdquo; she relates. &ldquo;They received wonderful services that bonded us together, and they opened their hearts to our truth. Though they had never heard about Seventh-day Adventists, they were now listening to what I had to share about Adventists.&rdquo; Even today, the couple is still in touch with Ivonne, asking her to visit them and to share more truth.</p>
    <p>These are just a few drops from the ocean of testimonies. God did great things on that day, and we still pray for those people whom we met. We look forward to doing more outreach for God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
